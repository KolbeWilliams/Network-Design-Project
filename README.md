# Network-Design-Project
In this project, I designed a network based on a hypothetical RFP from two brothers who want to install a network in their apartment. Included are the logical/physical diagrams of the network along with the equipment/costs and installation timeline. Finally, a response to the RFP outlining the potential network and its requirements is included.
